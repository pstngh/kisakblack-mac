# KisakBlack, mac-port branch

Decompiled Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer, being ported to native macOS on
Apple Silicon (arm64). Read HANDOFF.md for status and next steps, and
docs/64bit.md before touching anything that handles pointers.

## Build (macOS)

```sh
cmake -S . -B build_macos -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
ninja -C build_macos            # -> build_macos/blackops
```

The Windows (MSVC x86) and Linux (GCC i386) builds must keep working. They can't
be built here, so check every changed file with
`python3 tools/check_file.py build_macos --i386 <files>` as well as without
`--i386`. Known artefacts of the i386 check (not code errors): phys_gjk.cpp
"expects x87 floats", cm_mesh.cpp long double, TargetConditionals.h, SDL headers,
and the gfx_gl/ files (they include the macOS GLEW header).

## Run

Game data: /Users/pstn/Documents/Games/codbo. From that directory:

```sh
/Users/pstn/Documents/kisakblack-mac/build_macos/blackops +set fs_basepath /Users/pstn/Documents/Games/codbo +set dedicated 1 +set developer 1
```

macOS has no `timeout`; use `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 60 <cmd>`, or
`perl tools/run_sampled.pl <seconds> <log> <cmd...>` to run, capture every
thread's stack (macOS `sample`) into `<log>.sample`, and kill it. Crash
backtraces print from the signal handler; `atos -o build_macos/blackops <addr>`
symbolizes after subtracting the slide (compare `nm` of CrashHandler with its
printed address). `lldb --batch -o run -k "bt" -k "frame variable" -- <cmd>`
works; if a launch under lldb hangs in dyld `open`, kill leftover blackops
processes first. lldb turns ASLR off (image at 0x100000000), which hides bugs
that depend on the image address: reproduce outside it too.

A map with bots: add `+set developer_script 1 +set scr_testclients 4 +map mp_nuked`
(the bots come from the `/# #/` blocks of maps/mp/gametypes/_dev.gsc). Drop
`+set dedicated 1` for the client (a listen server; the player may stay on the team
menu, there is no input). `KB_ASSERT_BT=1` prints a backtrace the first time each
assert fires.

A client and a dedicated server as separate processes (UDP over loopback): start
the server with `+set net_port 28960` (plus the bots and `+map` above), then, once
its map is up (~20 s), the client with `+set net_port 28961 +connect 127.0.0.1:28960`.
Without Steam any client is accepted (stubs_online.cpp). The engine keeps at most
32 `+` commands from the command line and silently drops the rest (`com_consoleLines`). Two processes need
`perl -e 'alarm ...'` each, or kill them yourself; leftover servers keep the port.

Offline stats (rank, unlocks, custom classes) live in `<home>/players/mpstats.dat`;
the home path dvar is `fs_h` (defaults to the base path, i.e. the user's real
profile). Test runs that touch stats should pass `+set fs_h <scratch dir>`.
Everything is unlocked and owned, rank 50/prestige 15, by default (HANDOFF,
session 8); to test the progression underneath, pass `+set allItemsUnlocked 0
+set allItemsPurchased 0 +set allEmblemsUnlocked 0 +set allEmblemsPurchased 0`.
Item indices are the rows of mp/statsTable.csv (e.g. 43 L96A1, 150/151
Lightweight/Pro, 209 Attack Dogs); `statReadDDL cacLoadouts customclass1 primary`
prints a loadout slot.

Playing without a keyboard: `KB_CMDS` runs console commands at times (seconds) after
the client becomes active in a map (again after each map change), `|`-separated;
entries after `loop@<start>/<period>` repeat. `+set scr_tdm_timelimit 1` ends a
match after a minute, to test the end of a match and map rotation. This joins, picks a class and fights:

```sh
KB_CMDS='8:openscriptmenu team_marinesopfor autoassign|11:openscriptmenu changeclass assault_mp,0|loop@14/10|0:+forward|1:+attack|2.5:-attack|3:+right|3.6:-right|4:+gostand|4.2:-gostand|5:+usereload|5.2:-usereload|6:weapnext|7:+frag|7.3:-frag|9.5:-forward'
```

`changeclass custom1,0` (to `custom5`, then `prestige1`-`prestige5`) picks a
custom class. `KB_MENU_CMDS` takes the same list but times it from startup and runs it once,
in a map or not: the main menu (`12:openmenu cac_main|30:quit`).

Seeing the client: `screencapture` lacks Screen Recording permission and the
console is unreachable, so `KB_SCREENSHOT=<dir> KB_SCREENSHOT_EVERY=<n>` writes the
back buffer as `<dir>/present_N.tga` every n presents (with draw counters on stderr).
`KB_TRACEFRAME=n1,n2` logs those frames' render-target/viewport/clear/blit/draw
calls and, with KB_SCREENSHOT, dumps the back buffer at the first resolves.

AddressSanitizer: configure `build_asan` with `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address
-fno-omit-frame-pointer"` (same for C and the linker). ASan's dlopen interceptor
makes sdl2-compat look for libSDL3 next to the ASan runtime, so copy
`libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib` into `build_asan/asanrt/`, symlink
`/opt/homebrew/lib/libSDL3.dylib` there, and run with
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build_asan/asanrt`. SIP strips `DYLD_*` when it runs
/usr/bin/perl or /bin/bash, so don't launch through those wrappers.

The agent shell's `grep` is a function that skips Latin-1 files (19 sources,
g_main_mp.cpp among them); search with `command grep -a`.

## Conventions

- Match the decompiled style around the edit; no reformatting.
- Pointer <-> 32-bit int: `Ptr32_Encode` / `Ptr32_Decode`. Never `.v`/`.get()`
  on a Ptr32 (it is `T*` on 32-bit builds): use `Ptr32_Raw`/`Ptr32_SetRaw` or a cast.
- Asset and networked structs keep the i386 layout: `tools/layout_diff.py`.
- Commit messages end with the Co-Authored-By line the session provides.
